*Fast, serializable, hash-invariant data format*  
  
HiBON is a data format inspired by [BSON](https://bsonspec.org/) and developed for the [Tagion network](https://www.tagion.org).  
  
It's a serializable binary format which is strongly typed and defines explicit ordering to achive hash-invariance.  
It's minimal and designed to be quick to encode, decode and verify.
