The HiBON format is designed to have the following properties.

1. Hash invariant.
2. It is efficient to store in a consensus database like the DART.
3. It is simple to verify data integrity like hashing and digital signatures.
4. Efficient serialisation and deserialisation.
5. Streamable data format.
6. A small memory footprint means a low bandwidth requirement.
7. Simple for embedded hardware/software process.
